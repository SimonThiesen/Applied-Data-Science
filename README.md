Based on the data foundation the study precedes to dive deeper into traditional data mining approaches and how highly unstructured data can be processed, analysed, improved and evaluated. Through the analysis, the best performing model given the context, was concluded to be the logistic regression yielding an accuracy of 80.8%  and thereby outperforming lexicons and other common approaches. The improvement strategies implemented resulted in a 7.5%-point increased performance, compared to the baseline model.
